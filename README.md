# LogitechRestarter
Simple software to restart Logitech Gaming Software after sleep events

The Logitech Restarter runs in the background waiting for a sleep event.
When it detects that the PC has woken from sleep, it terminates the Logitech’s Gaming Software (LGS) and restarts it,
reestablishing the connection between the software and the keyboard’s display.

If you don’t have a Logitech keyboard with a display and/or don’t put your PC to sleep,
this application won’t be helpful (but it shouldn’t do any harm).

At the time of writing (2014-12-29), this has been tested only on  Windows 7 64 bit with a G510.
If you find other configurations work/don’t work/cause Horrors from the Unknown to appear – do let me know.
